        <description>A binding for the Velux KLF200 Bridge. The Velux Binding interacts via a Velux Bridge with the different Velux devices
                like controlling window openers, shutters and others. For example a KLF200 can act as interface between the HomeAutomation
                and the VELUX INTEGRA products with wireless connectivity based on the io-homecontrol standard.
